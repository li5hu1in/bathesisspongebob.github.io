                <i>SpongeBob SquarePants</i> is one of the most famous and longest-running American animated comedy television series. While the show has been the subject of some research in recent years, most of it has focused on linguistic aspects. A few researchers have also discussed its social and cultural function as a children's program, and its construction of gender and relationships. However, few has been seen to probe into the geographies of the show.

                Cultural geography, which examines how place, society, and culture interact, is one of the sub-branches of human geography. It has been adopted as a theoretical framework to analyze various types of texts. This research provides a cultural geographical examination of spaces and landscapes in this show and the socio-cultural and symbolic meanings they convey. Through textual analysis and case studies, this thesis explores how the animation’s colorful, whimsical landscapes of Tentacle Acres, Glove World!, Sandy’s treedome, Jellyfish Fields, and Bottomite buildings reflect and comment on modernity, social solitude, science and technology, and environmentalism, respectively. The results reveal that the geographies of SpongeBob are rich with implicit messages and provide a projection of reality. These findings may contribute to the growing field of animation geography and suggest that cartoons can serve as a medium for manifesting and satirizing reality.
