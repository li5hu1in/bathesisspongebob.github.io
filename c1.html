                Film geography, as a subdiscipline of cultural geography, is a long-established field of research. Since its establishment more than twenty years ago, it has diversified into a variety of different branches, with one of them focusing on animations. Animation endows abstract shapes with engaging characteristics in reality (Harrison 1981:69). Comparing to films that are set in the real world, it is given more latitude and flexibility in character and setting design. Interestingly, this does not hinder its capability to transmit messages and meanings. As Harrison (1981:69) notes, “like statistic, the cartoon can summarize a vast body of data in a succinct symbol.” This ability is granted by utilizing certain standard codes created by individual cartoonists, which involve some specific details of figures coming from the reality (Osler 1982:77), like giving inanimate objects human-like eyes, arms, and legs.

                <i>SpongeBob SquarePants</i>, sometimes shortened to be SpongeBob, is an American animated comedy television series. It has become one of the most well-known and longest-running cartoon series worldwide, since its first airing on Nickelodeon channel on May 1, 1999. Nowadays, the show has a global fan base and exerts a profound impact on pop culture, as the image of a yellow sponge living in a pineapple under the sea has become deeply ingrained in the minds of many audiences. Set in the fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom, <i>SpongeBob SquarePants</i> centers on the adventurous life of the eponymous protagonist, who is an energetic sea sponge, and his aquatic friends, such as Patrick Star the starfish, Squidward Tentacles the octopus, Sandy Cheeks the squirrel, Mr. Krabs the crab, Plankton the copepod, etc. (<i>SpongeBob SquarePants</i> (series) 2023). For viewers of all ages, the animated program features humor, creativity, camaraderie, and inspirational messages. Despite being labeled as children’s show in the U.S., it also catches on with adolescents and adults. According to statistics (Armstrong 2002:44), three years after the debut of SpongeBob, one in every three of its audience was over 18 years old.

                The creator of <i>SpongeBob SquarePants</i>, Stephen Hillenburg, was an American animator, cartoonist, marine biologist, and marine science educator. Hillenburg had a lifelong fascination for the ocean and a passion for drawing. Therefore, he combined these interests and developed the concept for this animated show in the late 1990s. He served as its first showrunner from 1999 to 2004 and remained involved with the show as an executive producer and consultant until his death in 2018 (Stephen Hillenburg 2023). Hillenburg’s background in marine biology is believed to have had a significant impact on the creation of <i>SpongeBob SquarePants</i>. Many of its characters and settings in the animation series are inspired by real-life marine creatures and locations.
            </p>

            <p>
                In recent years, <i>SpongeBob SquarePants</i> has received attention from some researchers. For example, Rice (2009:1096) discusses how does it function as a children’s show and what do audiences gain from the show both positively and negatively; Tarr and Brown (2013:20) analyze the projection of the American cultural ideal and the American dream on its characters; Groening (2011:52) revises the show’s underlying implication of the Cold War and nuclear crisis; Carter (2010:V) provides insights into the construction of gender and relationships in SpongeBob. Most of the research, however, focuses on the linguistic aspects, such as the speech act, politeness strategies, and humor translation (Mutmainah and Baihaqi 2018:139; Sari 2020:126; Xia et al. 2023:1), etc. Few has been seen to probe into the geographies of the show, which is a crucial part in film and animation production. Therefore, this research examines some spaces and landscapes in Bikini Bottom with concrete examples from a cultural geographical perspective, aiming to discover their embedded social implications. Specifically, the study will attempt to answer these research questions: (1) How are specific spaces and landscapes being constructed in <i>SpongeBob SquarePants</i>? (2) To what extent do they convey socio-cultural and symbolic meanings that reflect and influence reality?

            <h3>1.1 Cultural Geography</h3>

            <p>
                Cultural geography, which examines how place, society, and culture interact, occupies one of the sub-branches of human geography. Over the years, the field has evolved into distinct stages: the old cultural geography and the new cultural geography, also known as the Berkley School and the Birmingham School, respectively. Representatives of the old cultural geography, Carl Sauer and Wilbur Zelinsky, proposed the prevailing view of culture over nature. It is culture that controls people to remold the environment and reshape it into landscapes that correspond with their identities. On the contrary, the environment cannot determine any human actions (Zelinsky 1992:114; Sauer 2008:108).
            </p>

            <p>
                After 1980, culture became more diversified and politicized due to the increasing population, capital, and technological fluidity. The left-wing perspective, represented by Western Marxism, flourished, and cultural geography underwent an important phase as “cultural turn,” which made it officially entering the new cultural geography stage (Cosgrove 1998:3; Cresswell 2010:169). With the “cultural turn”, new cultural geography focuses on many scenarios that are explicitly or implicitly discriminatory, oppressive, exclusionary, and unjust (such as women’s space, LGBTQ+ space, and homeless space) (Cosgrove 1998:xvi). It replaces natural space with social space, which is a major characteristic of the themes studied under this new theoretical framework. Birmingham School scholars believe that geography is constructed and represented, as a carrier of symbolic meaning and political power, and a medium for cultural struggle between different groups. Peter Jackson and Denis Cosgrove, British geographers who were pioneers of the new cultural geography, emphasize the internal operation of culture, the production of symbols, and value connotations. From the new cultural geographical perspective, the landscape is no longer an objective, unobstructed scene, but a subjective “text” that requires interpretation (Cosgrove and Jackson 1987:96). The new cultural geography aims to elucidate all issues related to symbol meaning, textual misreading, and creative interpretation (Jackson 2012:6). It emphasizes the importance of geographical imagination in social changes (Cresswell 2010:171).
            </p>

            <p>
                During the transitional phase, the subject went through a methodological combat –between analyzing geography from a representational perspective or a non-representational one. Hall (2020:74) suggests that one general definition of representation is the production of meaning through language. It links mental, imaginary worlds to the reality. Representation is a process involving two systems, namely concept and language. Through them people construct, stabilize, and internalize meanings within their own culture and spread them across different regions around the world (Hall 2020:75). Adopting representational perspective, scholars interpret the meaning of geographies through the lens of symbol and sign. Daniels (2002:212) explores how the mundane daily landscapes accommodate the tendency to conceal or dissolve political notions like power and conflict as people put emphases on the symbolic and material dimensions of artifacts, like fields of corps and landscape parks. Highlighting the duality of material and power in the essence of landscape, he attempts to find a balance between materiality and subjectivity. Similarly, Duncan (1994:401) views landscape as a form of sign system, proposing that the “domestication, objectification, and naturalization of landscape obscures the ideology within it.” Dennis Cosgrove and Peter Jackson (1987:98) advocate studying landscapes from a representational perspective, exploring the symbolic meaning of landscapes. They believe that it involves the processes of “encoding” and “decoding,” while culture and power are two important forces that “encode” and “decode” landscapes.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since the 21st century, cultural geography has increasingly adopted a non-representational perspective, emphasizing experiences, affects, emotions, practices, mobility, intimacy, ethnographic immersion, and observation beyond and prior to representation. Anderson and Smith (2001:7) introduce a geographical agenda which is sensitive to the emotional dimensions of everyday life, marking the inception of “emotional turn” in cultural geography. Non-representational geography focuses on the construction and expression of landscapes through concrete, perceptible, and contextualized daily life and emotions (Lorimer 2008:551). Its theoretical foundations include embodiment, materiality, feminist geography, humanistic geography, non-representational theory, and psychoanalytic methods, while the research areas feature the situatedness of affects, the affective ties between humans and environments, and the materialization of emotional geographies (Anderson and Smith 2001; Bondi et al. 2016). The topics cover emotions, ecology, climate change, intimate spaces, politics, education, place and belonging, race, and emotional geography of special populations (Anderson and Smith 2001:7; Bondi 2005:433; Nayak 2011:548; Ryan 2016:5).
            </p>

            <p>
                Both representational and non-representational methods offer distinct benefits and drawbacks. Research following the former way is heavily relied on text, image, sign, and symbol that it can neglect the dynamic, spontaneous experience of landscape and space. In contrast, the latter one involves ethnographic research, combining observation methods, and in-depth interviews. It can create a more intimate and individual report of the scene. The two approaches, however, are not entirely mutually exclusive. While representation allows one to see the world from an abstract point of view, non-representation gives them opportunity to evaluate it more closely and concretely (Helbrecht 2004:194). Despite bearing vast divergence in the pivots of their philosophy, representational and non-representational approaches are inseparable. Representation and abstraction is required in recording and reporting non-representational practices (Thrift 2008:195). This research attempts to combine these two perspectives effectively in analyzing the object.

            <h3>1.2 Space and Landscape</h3>

            <p>
                In cultural geography, space and landscape are essential concepts that provide insight into the production of cultural phenomena. Space is a social construction crucial to the understanding of different histories of human subjects and the production of cultural phenomena (Arias and Warf 2009:1). It encompasses many features of human life: place, location, locality, landscape, environment, home, city, region, territory, and geography (Soja 1998:137–138). Cultural geographers propose that there are three types of urban spaces: Firstplace, as the material space; Secondspace, as the representation of how people conceive the space in their mind; Thirdspace, as the lived spaces that coexist with material space and spaces of representation (Chouinard 1999:209), or to say, a specific way of thinking about and interpreting socially produced space (Borch 2002:113).
            </p>

            <p>
                The conceptual reference of the landscape has been broadened considerably within half a century. Its original meaning, as for Carl Sauer and his followers in the ‘Berkeley School’ in the 1950s, mainly referred to rural and antiquarian physical artifacts, and the critique of the landscape was to map visible elements of material culture produced by unitary groups (Cosgrove and Jackson 1987:96). Decades later, as geography was inclined to be considered as a force for social changes, landscape was regarded as a cultural image, a particular way of composing, structuring, and giving social meaning to an external world (Cosgrove and Daniels 1988:1). Landscape is a text that can be read and interpreted, and that the construction of landscape involves negotiations among a group of different social actors (Davis 2009:59).

            <h3>1.3 Geographies in Film and Animation</h3>

            <p>
                There has always been a connection between media products and geography. Landscape painting, as a form of artistic manifestation of space, has appeared in Europe during the Renaissance (Lefebvre 2006:xiii). Landscape photography, which emerged about a century ago, also demonstrates human’s interest towards filmic landscape (Zschocke 2022:86). Martin Lefebvre (Lefebvre 2006:XV) argues that people perceive nature through framing, which refers to the act of visually isolating a natural object or scene with devices such as camera viewfinders, the frames of train, or car windows. People gaze through a frame, and then the land becomes a landscape. Therefore, the concept of landscape implies a strong sense of human intervention. In other words, there is no such thing as “natural” landscape. The study of landscape, whether it is in real-world environments or artistic works, essentially involves the study of cultural issues. Similar to this process, watching films and animations on a screen is like gazing through a frame. Then, in an interpretive gaze, landscape manifests itself (Lefebvre 2006:51).
            </p>

            <p>
                When studying film geography, two terms that are worth clarifying are setting and landscape. Setting is the scenery of and the theater for what will happen, whether detailed or vague (Lefebvre 2006:21). However, it can never get rid of narratives as its function is to provide interior and exterior space for characters and events. Only when space is freed from narrative can it gain its autonomy (Lefebvre 2006:23). So can it guide the gaze of the audiences, calling for interpretation.
            </p>

            <p>
                The emergence of landscape as a form of representation, combined with cultural geographers’ growing interest in popular culture, sparked a critical examination of the ideological framework of landscapes on television and cinema (Lukinbeal and Sharp 2014:7). Burgess (1987:1), for instance, questioned the ability of landscapes to conceal their own production and present these images as “natural”. Lukinbeal (2005:3) developed a categorical approach to interpreting cinematic landscapes, using the metaphor of text as a tool for reading movie images. Other scholars, such as Escher and Zimmermann (2001:227), have explored the various roles that landscape plays in feature films, including as a setting, guarantor of credibility, metaphor, myth, actor, location, and tourist destination.  These works have led to a renewed academic passion in the question of cinematic landscapes since the 21st century. Lefebvre (2006:xii) draws from multiple fields to query the ontology and epistemological interlinkages of cinema and landscape. In addition, Melbye (2010:18) examines the collective cultural meaning of landscapes in cinema, asking at what point a landscape functions psychologically beyond its usual role as a backdrop.
            </p>

            <p>
                Animation, as another form of media product, is frequently overlooked by scholars. Considering its symbolic and metamorphic nature (Pallant 2011:146), it has greater latitude in depicting space and landscape. Being traditionally realistic or extremely creative are both acceptable in making cartoons (Pallant 2011:143). Consequently, interesting, even droll spectacles can often appear in these artworks without offending the audiences. Researchers can apply the framework of animation geography by examining the spatial and environmental elements of animated productions as cultural texts, in a similar vein to the methodology of film geography.
