                This study contributes to cultural geographical research on the program <i>SpongeBob SquarePants</i> in relation to the research questions concerning: (1) How are specific spaces and landscapes being constructed in <i>SpongeBob SquarePants</i>? (2) To what extent do they convey socio-cultural and symbolic meanings that reflect and influence reality? Generally speaking, spaces and landscapes in the show are constructed in an exaggerated, colorful, and whimsical way, which are congruous with its intended audience as a children’s animated series. Besides, they can be considered as vessels that encapsulate the characters’ identities and Stephen Hillenburg’s social commentary on the intersection of modernity.

                So, how does geographies of <i>SpongeBob SquarePants</i> reflect the creator’s thought and concern? He embedded the worries about the adverse consequences in Tentacle Acres and Glove World!. Tentacle Acres can be seen as a parody of a New Urbanist city. The town is exclusive to octopuses, with a meticulously planned layout and a strong sense of community, but lacks uniqueness and individuality. The portrayal of Glove World!’s thrilling landscape represents a culture of consumerism and instant gratification. The absurdity of Squidville and Glove World! highlights the negative aspects of modernization, urbanization, and industrialization, such as the loss of individuality and the exploitation of people’s desires for material possessions. Moreover, Sandy’s airtight treedome can be seen as a metaphor for her identity as an outsider. Its resemblance to Biosphere 2 symbolizes human’s exploration of the universe. Additionally, Hillenburg expressed his vision of environmentalism through the depiction of the landscapes of Jellyfish Fields and Bittomite buildings, encouraging viewers to consider how they can protect the natural world and live sustainably. Overall, spaces and landscapes in SpongeBob are portrayed as a mild irony to the reality. The abundant implications behind are worth analyzing.

                This study identified implicit messages communicated in the geographies of <i>SpongeBob SquarePants</i> using textual analysis and case studies. Despite textual analysis enables researchers to locate inherent meaning in media messages that viewers often miss, it has its limitations. The findings rely heavily on the researcher’s ability to gaze at and interpret the cartoon. Hillenburg created such a splendid underwater world that there are still ample places in Bikini Bottom that can be read and deconstruct. The results of this analysis suggest that copious information can be extracted from cartoons with geographical imagination. Within their surreal, even sometimes silly contexts, cartoons are able to satirize reality and subvert dominant beliefs with remarkable ease (Carter 2010:32). Additional research is still needed in terms of animation geography, and further studies on the program <i>SpongeBob SquarePants</i> are recommended.
